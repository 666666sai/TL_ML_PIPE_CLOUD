logistic regression stpes to learn:

1) Data Cleaning and Preparation
   Handling Missing Values
   Outlier Detection and Treatment
   Feature Engineering and Transformation
   Scaling/Normalization
   Create New Features: Combine or transform existing features to create more predictive ones (e.g., Age / Income ratio).
2) Data Splitting

3) Model Training
   Fit the Model
   Prediction
4) Model Evaluation
   Accuracy
   Confusion Matrix
   Precision
   Recall
   F1-Score
5) Model Tuning (Hyperparameter Optimization)
    
6) Final Evaluation

binary classification:  have results(calsses) only two
multiclass classification: have multiple results more two
